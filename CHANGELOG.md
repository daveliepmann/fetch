## 0.1.0 - 2018-03-05
### Added
- Initialized project, copying basic code from our internal fetch ns and cleaning up slightly
- Specifically, we have the concept of a middleware that binds get, post, and a generic request function in to each handler, with sync versions of each.
- Internal tests for this project, and providing the error handling code are all very much TODO.
